# Answer
The contract has a state variable total that stores the sum of the prime numbers.

The TotalPrimeNumbers function takes an array of numbers as an argument. It iterates over this array, and for each number, it checks if the number is prime. If the number is not prime, it skips to the next iteration. If the number is prime and less than or equal to 15, it adds the number to total. If the number is prime and greater than 15, it stops the loop and returns.


There are a few potential issues with this contract:

1. The TotalPrimeNumbers function stops counting as soon as it encounters a prime number greater than 15. This means that if the array contains prime numbers less than or equal to 15 after a prime number greater than 15, these numbers will not be counted. This could lead to an inaccurate total.

2. The total state variable is public and can be viewed by anyone, but it can only be modified by the TotalPrimeNumbers function. If the contract owner wants to reset the total or set it to a specific value, they cannot do so.

3. The TotalPrimeNumbers function does not reset the total state variable before it starts counting. This means that if the function is called multiple times, the new total will be added to the previous total. This could lead to an inaccurate total if the function is called more than once.

4. The isPrime function is marked as private, which means it can only be called from within the contract. If the contract owner wants to check if a specific number is prime without adding it to the total, they cannot do so.

*How can I fix the issue of the TotalPrimeNumbers function stopping at numbers greater than 15 in the PrimeCollector contract?*

# Solution
We can fix this issue by moving the check for numbers greater than 15 inside the isPrime condition. This way, the function will continue to iterate over the entire array, but it will only add prime numbers that are less than or equal to 15 to the total. Here's how you can do it:

`// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

contract PrimeCollector {
    uint256 public total;

    function TotalPrimeNumbers(uint256[] calldata numbers) external {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            // skip non-prime numbers or numbers greater than 15
            if (!isPrime(numbers[i]) || numbers[i] > 15) {
                continue;
            }

            // Add up the prime numbers that are 15 or less
            total += numbers[i];
        }
    }
    // Function to check if a number is prime (implementation not shown for brevity)
    function isPrime(uint256 number) private pure returns (bool) {
        // logic to check for a prime number
    }
}`
In this updated version, the TotalPrimeNumbers function continues to iterate over the entire array regardless of the value of the numbers. However, it only adds a number to total if the number is prime and less than or equal to 15.
